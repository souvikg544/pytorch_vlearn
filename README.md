Pytorch is the cool guy while tensorflow is the angry uncle .
Now this cool guy uses easy english and loves python the snake while this angry uncle uses very tough language and loves only himself not the cute snake python.But would you just learn about the cool dude and ignore the uncle ? No ! The uncle knows a lot and people love uncle too ! Even I love uncle ! 
Heres a set of notebooks from my learning of pytorch
